## Hi, I'm Amy 👋

I'm a web programmer (full stack), a veteran, a yogi, and a human multi-tool.

I love solving problems, creating stuff, and trying new things.

#### I usually build with React/Javascript et al. but i have experience with other web frameworks and languages including: 
* SQL (♡)
* Java
* ASP.NET/C#
* Python
* PHP & Laravel (♡)
* WordPress (♡)

#### I also have experience with web development and governance infrastructure in the crypto space:
* Ethereum Javascript libraries: WAGMI/Viem/Ethers
* Token standards & basic Ethereum smart contracts
* ENS, Snapshot, Safe (formerly Gnosis), & other dApps & services
* Arweave permanent onchain storage
* Farcaster Frames protocol


#### Some fun stuff I'm hacking my way through right now:
* automation & file manipulation with Node scripting
* exploring the built-in Web APIs, such as Web Audio and IndexedDB
* Custom WordPress themes and Laravel applications with PHP

#### Samples and deployment links to some of my work can be found in my portfolio [here](https://amy-enn.vercel.app).

### Thanks for stopping by!
