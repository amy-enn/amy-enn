## Hi, I'm Amy

I'm a web programming student (full stack), a veteran, a yogi, and a human multi-tool.

I usually build with React/Javascript et al. but i have experience with other web frameworks and languages including 
* SQL (♡).
* Java (♡)
* ASP.NET/C#
* Python

I also have experience with web development and governance infrastructure in the crypto space.

I love solving problems, creating stuff, and trying new things.

### Thanks for stopping by!
