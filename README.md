## Hi, I'm Amy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web programming student (full stack), a veteran, a yogi, and a human multi-tool.

I love solving problems, creating stuff, and trying new things.

#### I usually build with React/Javascript et al. but i have experience with other web frameworks and languages including: 
* SQL (â™¡).
* Java (â™¡)
* ASP.NET/C#
* Python
* Basic Node scripting (â™¡)

#### I also have experience with web development and governance infrastructure in the crypto space:
* Ethereum Javascript libraries: WAGMI/Viem/Ethers
* Token standards & basic Ethereum smart contracts
* ENS, Snapshot, Safe (formerly Gnosis), & other dApps & services


#### Some fun stuff I'm hacking my way through right now:
* simulating physics in the browser with P5.js
* data visualization with Chart.js and D3.js
* adding PostgreSQL databases to a few of my portfolio apps

#### Samples and deployment links to some of my work can be found in my portfolio [here](https://amy-enn.vercel.app).

### Thanks for stopping by!
